## Overview
Kitsat is a personal ORBS blockchain to empower developers to easily and efficiently deploy, run & test smart contracts.<enter>
Kitsat runs an in-memory ORBS blockchain with N nodes on your local machine. 
The Command line interface is deisnged to help you an interact with the blockchain network. 


## Getting Started... 

### Requirements
- Go 1.10.X installed 
- Mac or Linux (Windows support coming soon)

### Installation  
The installation of a personal ORBS and the command line interface is done by running the following command: 
- TODO: Add the command 

* To validate that the installation of Kitsat- [TODO]

### Let's start with examples 

2 examples are provided to quickly get started:
*[Counter contract](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contract-sdk/tree/master/go/examples/counter "Counter Contract") - designed to show you how to read and write state variables.<ENTER>
*[MyToken contract](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contract-sdk/tree/master/go/examples/MyToken "Counter Contract") - designed to show you how to implement token contract with accounts to store balances.

**To deploy one of the contracts above :**
```go
TODO

```
**To test the exmaple contracts:**

Part of the TDD methodology we adopted at ORBS, please find complementary test files for the examples above.<enter>

*[Counter Tests] - TODO

*[Token Tests] - TODO


```go
